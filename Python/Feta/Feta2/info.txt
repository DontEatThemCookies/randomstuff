Feta is a joke programming language created by Nicholas Smith as a glitch to the BBC question about false programming languages on 30 May, 2013. It contains only one instruction: "WRITE", that prints "H3110 W0R1D" in an external text file named "0WTPWT.txt". It was designed to be an April Fools Joke on the GlobalGameDevelopersForum site.

Syntax is very simple: The one and only instruction is "WRITE".

Details

Specification: Feta programming language
Classification: Joke/Esoteric
Filename: feta.py
Lines: 4
Size: 121 bytes
Implementation Language: CPython
Feta specification compliance: 100%

Usage

Upon startup of feta.py, you will be prompted for input.
The only valid instruction is "WRITE" - any other input will be ignored. Note that the "WRITE" instruction is case-sensitive.

Once the "WRITE" command is issued, it creates a file named "0WTPWT.txt" and writes the following text to it:

H3110 W0R1D

This CPython implementation has no function to exit, as it has not been provisioned for in the original specification. You may, however, still use Ctrl+C or close the terminal.
