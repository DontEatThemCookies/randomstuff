echo LogTool Help
echo ------------------------
echo Welcome to LogTool! This tool is intended to help you manage your time automating the
echo creation of text files to store log entries on. This help section aims to clarify the
echo function of this tool. Read on to learn more!
pause
cls
echo LogTool Introduction
echo ------------------------
echo LogTool works through the use of definitions. What are these definitions? They are
echo important information LogTool needs to successfully perform. There are two of them. First,
echo the destination directory. Second, the message to put in the entry. These two definitions
echo are easily changeable through the OPTIONS. Let's learn about the options menu!
pause
cls
echo LogTool Options
echo ------------------------
echo Upon launching the program, you are presented with three input choices. The OPTIONS menu
echo is one of them. Once you navigate to it, there are two configurable settings presented.
echo It is through these options you can customize the aforementioned definitions. First, the:
echo ------------------------
echo DESTINATION DIRECTORY
echo The destination directory is where LogTool puts your files. On first time use, this is
echo NOT defined. The recommended directory is your desktop, but you can define any valid
echo directory to the tool. The recommended directory is:
echo ------------------------
echo C:\Users\[Account Username]\Desktop\log.txt
echo ------------------------
echo Replace [Acccount Username] with the username of the account you are currently using
echo to run and use LogTool. 
echo ------------------------
echo Ready to learn about the next definition? If so,
pause
cls
echo CUSTOM MESSAGE
echo A custom message is a changeable line of text that is inserted into every entry you log. echo On first time use, this is defined as "Hello World." You can easily change this to any
echo text you desire. For example:
echo ------------------------
echo The Custom Message has been set to: It is morning, today looks great!
echo ------------------------
echo Ready to learn about logging itself? If so,
pause
cls
echo LogTool - Logging
echo ------------------------
echo This is the core feature of LogTool, as can be inferred from the name - logging. It's
echo quite straightforward. Upon program startup, input 1 and press ENTER. Then, it asks for
echo you to confirm the action in a prompt. After that, LogTool gets to work!
echo If it succeeds, you can navigate to the destination directory and see the entry.
echo If it fails, it's either because of insufficient access permissions or an invalid
echo directory. Run as administrator to fix the first problem.
pause
cls

echo If you encounter errors/bugs, please contact me at the e-mail veryrisible@gmail.com
echo ------------------------
echo We're finishing now!
pause
echo That's LogTool explained in this handy guide. Don't hesitate to shoot an e-mail for any
echo feedback, comments, questions or bug reports. Have a nice day.
